# WebScrapingProject
What was the biggest challenge of scraping the web site?

Some of the challenges that I encountered were:
  I had a "Unicorn Error",
  I couldn't use the next button icon (">") so the webdriver could move from one page to another,
  At first I couldn't get the data that I was scraping into the csv file due to several errors.


What insight, if any, did you gain from the analysis and visualization of the laptop data?

Looking at the data and comparing the price to the reviews....there is no clear correlation. The laptop with the highest reviews (60) is $1,217 and the next highest laptop reviews (31) has a price of $445. One of the laptops with a low review(1) has a price of $1,299. So clearly, reviews and price have no correlation with one another.
